# Threads Folder

This folder stores small, independent task records.

## Rules

- Keep each file small and actionable.
- No large architecture write-ups here.
- Link to source files and commits when possible.
- Keep status explicit: `todo`, `doing`, `done`, `blocked`.

## Recommended Sections

- Context
- Goal
- Plan
- Execution Log
- Result
- Next Actions

Use `TEMPLATE.md` to start new tasks.
